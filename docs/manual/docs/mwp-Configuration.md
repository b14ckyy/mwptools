# mwp Configuration

## Overview

{{ mwp }} stores configuration in a number of places, to some degree at the developer's whim, but also in accordance with the data item's volatility.

* Command line options
* Configuration Files
* dconf / gsettings

Each type is further discussed below.

## Command line options

Command line options provide a 'per instantiation' means to control {{ mwp }} behaviour; the current set of command line options may be viewed by running {{ mwp }} from the command line with the single option `--help`:

    $ mwp --help

Where it is required to give permanence to command line options, they can be added to the configuration file `$HOME/.config/mwp/cmdopts` (on Windows `$LOCALAPPDATA/mwp/cmdopts`), which is described in more detail in the following section.

Note that the documentation will habitually refer to the configuration base directory as `~/.config` as that is where it is found on the majority of OS; if you're using Windows, please adjust as necessary.

You can also use a system-wide "cmdopts" file, `/etc/default/mwp`. If this flie exists, it will read before the user's file.

* For singular options, any option in the user file will override the system file
* For multiply occurring options, e.g. `--radar-device`, definitions will be additive.
* Environment variables can be set from either or both files.

### Debug flags

The `--debug-flags` option takes a numeric value defines areas where additional debug information may be output.

| Value | Usage |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1     | Waypoints |
| 2     | Startup |
| 4     | MSP |
| 8     | ADHOC |
| 16    | RADAR |
| 32    | (unused) |
| 64    | SERIAL |
| 128   | VIDEO |
| 256   | GCS Location |
| 512   | Line of sight |
| 1024  | Radar |
| 2048  | Maps |

Values may be ORd together (so 4095 means all).

## Configuration Files

{{ mwp }} configuration files are stored in a standard directory `$HOME/.config/mwp`. This directory is created on first invocation if it does not exist.

### Platform differences

* POSIX XDG compliance :  User Configuration directory (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`)
* POSIX fallback : `$HOME/.config`
* Windows / Msys : `$LOCALAPPDATA` / `%LOCALAPPDATA%` / `$Env:LOCALAPPDATA`

The following files may be found in the `mwp` directory:

## `cmdopts`

The file `cmdopts` contains command line options that the user wishes to apply permanently (and conveniently when run from a launcher icon rather than the command line).

The file contains CLI options exactly as would be issued from the terminal. Options may be on separate lines, and blank lines and line prefixed with a hash '#' are ignored. For example:

In addition to options (`--`), the file may also contain environment variables e.g. `FOO=BAR`.

    # Default options for mwp
    --rings 50,20
    #--voice-command "spd-say -t female2 -e"
    #--debug-flags=2
    --dont-maximise
    #-S 8192
    # set the anonymous tile file.
    MWP_BLACK_TILE=/home/jrh/.config/mwp/mars.png

So here the only current, valid options are  `--rings 50,20 --dont-maximise`, and the [environment variable](#environment-variables) MWP_BLACK_TILE is set (for [anonymous maps](Black-Ops.md#custom-tile)).

The environment is set before any GTK / UI calls are made.

## Map Sources

{{ mwp }} provides by default:

* OpenStreetMap Mapnik
* OpenStreetMap Cycle Map
* OpenStreetMap Transport Map
* Maps for Free Relief
* Bing Maps (no API key required, for as long as the service remains available).
* MapBox (requires API key)
* ESRI Clarity

### Mapbox API Key management

In preparation for the announced removal of the Bing Maps service, `mwp` adds a `MapBox` entry where the user has acquired a [Mapbox API key](https://mapbox.com/).

This key may be either stored in the Desktop keyring (managed by `libsecret`) or as a plain text string in the `gsettings` database.

#### Keyring

Add to the keyring using `secret-tool` with the following attributes:

```
secret-tool store --label="Mapbox API" name mapbox-api-key domain org.stronnag.mwp
Password: *************************************************
```

#### Gsettings

Alternatively, the key can be added to the `gsettings` database:
```
 gsettings set org.stronnag.mwp mapbox-apikey 'pk.xxxxxxx'
 # where 'pk.xxxxxxx' is your MapBox API Key
```

Note that sadly `libshumate` creates a cache directory name from which the MapBox access token may be recovered, so there is little security / privacy gain by using the secret key-ring, alas. See [Gitlab issue](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libshumate/-/issues/84).

## Additional Map Sources: `sources.json`

`sources.json` facilitates adding non-standard map sources to {{ mwp }}. See the  [anonymous maps](Black-Ops.md#custom-tile) section and comments in the source files in the `qproxy` directory.

Here is an example `mwptools/src/samples/sources.json`.

    {
     "sources" : [
      {
          "id": "OpenTopoMP",
		  "name": "OpenTopo",
		  "license": "(c) OSM",
		  "license_uri": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright",
		  "min_zoom": 0,
		  "max_zoom": 19,
		  "tile_size": 256,
          "projection": "MERCATOR",
		  "uri_format": "http://map-proxy/mapproxy/tiles/1.0.0/opentopo/EPSG3857/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
      },
      {
          "id": "LandscapeMP",
		  "name": "Landscape",
		  "license": "(c) OSM",
		  "license_uri": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright",

          "projection": "MERCATOR",

      },
      {
          "id": "CyclemapMP",
		  "name": "Cyclemap",
		  "license": "(c) OSM",
		  "license_uri": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright",
		  "min_zoom": 0,
		  "max_zoom": 19,

          "projection": "MERCATOR",
		  "uri_format": "http://map-proxy/mapproxy/tiles/1.0.0/cyclemap/EPSG3857/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
      },
      {
          "id": "Black",
          "name": "Black Tiles",
          "license": "(c) jh ",
          "license_uri": "http://daria.co.uk/",
          "min_zoom": 0,
          "max_zoom": 20,
		  "tile_size": 256,
          "projection": "MERCATOR",
          "spawn" : "bproxy"
      }
     ]
    }

See also [anonymous maps](Black-Ops.md#custom-tile) to customise the "black tile". The `spawn` stanza uses a proxy for non-TMS formats (see `mwptools/src/qproxy` for some examples).

## `volts.css`

`vol.css` contains alternate CSS themeing for the battery voltage dock item that may work better on dark desktop themes. An example file is provided as `mwp/vcol.css` which can be copied into `.config/mwp/`.

## `places`

The `places` (`~/.config/mwp/places`) file is a delimited (CSV) file that defines a list of "shortcut" home locations used by the "View / Centre on Position ..." menu item. It consists of a Name, Latitude, Longitude and optionally zoom level, separated by a `TAB`,`|`,`:` or `;`. Note that positions may be localised in the file and thus `.` is no longer recognised as a field separator.

Example `places`

    # mwp places name,lat,lon [,zoom]
    Beaulieu|50.8047104|-1.4942621|17
    Jurby:54.353974:-4.523600:-1

The user may maintain these files manually if used, or use the [graphic places editor](misc-ui-elements.md#favourite-places). The command line option `--centre` accepts a place name as well as a geographic coordinates.

## Dconf / gsettings

The underlying infrastructure used by {{ mwp }} has a facility for storing configuration items in a registry like store. This is used extensively by {{ mwp }}. The items can viewed and modified using a number of tools:

* {{ mwp }} preference dialogue (for a small subset of the items)
* The `dconf-editor` graphical settings editor (Linux, FreeBSD)
* The command line `gsettings` tool (Linux, FreeBSD, Windows)
* Regedit (Windows)
* Text Editor (MacOS)

### MacOS (exception)

Gtk on MacOS does not support `gsettings` in a useful way. As a work around, MacOS settings are stored in a text `.ini` file, `$HOME/.config/mwp/mwp.ini`.

### Linux, FreeBSD, Windows

For `gsettings` and `dconf-editor`, the name-space is `org.stronnag.mwp`, so to view the list of items:

    $ gsettings list-recursively  org.stronnag.mwp

and to list then get / set a single item:

    $ gsettings get org.stronnag.mwp log-save-path
    ..
    $ gsettings set org.stronnag.mwp log-save-path ~/flight-logs/

#### dconf-editor

This *may* not be installed by default, but should be available via the OS package manager / software centre.

### Replicating gsettings between machines or users

The standard system `dconf` application can be used to back up and restore the above `gsettings`.
To backup the settings:

    dconf dump /org/stronnag/mwp  >/tmp/mwp-dconf.txt

To restore the settings (overwrite). This could be for a different user or on a new machine.

    dconf load /org/stronnag/mwp  </tmp/mwp-dconf.txt

## Settings precedence and user updates

{{ mwp }} installs a number of icon files in `$prefix/share/mwp/pixmaps`. The user can override these by creating an eponymous file in the user configuration directory, `~/.config/mwp/pixmaps/`. Such user configurations are never over-written on upgrade.

For example, to replace a {{ mwp }} specific icon; i.e. replace the GCS Location icon (`$prefix/share/mwp/pixmaps/gcs.svg`) with a user defined file `~/.config/mwp/pixmaps/gcs.svg`.

While the file name must be consistent, the format does not have to be; the replacement could be be a PNG, rather than SVG; we're not MSDOS and file "extensions" are an advisory illusion.

### Example

e.g. replace the inav-radar icon.

    mkdir -p ~/config/mwp/pixmaps
    # copy the preview image
    cp ~/.local/share/mwp/pixmaps/preview.png  ~/config/mwp/pixmaps/
    # (optionally) resize it to 32x32 pixels
    mogrify -resize 80% ~/config/mwp/pixmaps/preview.png
    # and rename it, mwp doesn't care about the 'extension', this is not MSDOS:)
    mv  ~/config/mwp/pixmaps/preview.png  ~/config/mwp/pixmaps/inav-radar.svg
    # and verify ... perfect
    file ~/.config/mwp/pixmaps/inav-radar.svg
    /home/jrh/.config/mwp/pixmaps/inav-radar.svg: PNG image data, 32 x 32, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced

Note also that the resize step is no longer required, as {{ mwp }} scales the icon according to the `misc-icon-size` setting.

## Environment variables

{{ mwp }} recognises the following application specific environment variables

| Name  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  | Usage |
| ------------- | ----- |
| `CFG_UGLY_XML` | Generate ugly multi-mission XML, so as not to confuse the inav configurator |
| `MWP_ARGS` | Extra command line arguments |
| `MWP_BLACK_TILE` | Specify a black tile to be used by the Black Tiles map proxy |
| `MWP_LOG_DIR` | Location of console logs ($HOME if undefined) |
| `MWP_PRINT_RAW` | If defined, output hex bytes from serial I/O |
| `MWP_TIME_FMT` | The time format for log output; by default "%FT%T%z", any GLib2 DateTime (strftime-like) format may be used; "%T.%f" works well on modern GLib. |

## Mime types for common file formats

{{ mwp }} adds XDG mime types for certain file types handled by mwp.

| Data Source | Mime Type | File Manager | DnD |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------ | ---- |
| Multiwii Mission (XML) | application/vnd.mw.mission | Yes [1](#mnote1) | Yes [2](#mnote2) |
| Blackbox log | application/vnd.blackbox.log | Yes | Yes |
| Mwp telemetry log | application/vnd.mwp.log | Yes | Yes |
| Multiwii mission (mwp JSON) | application/vnd.mwp.json.mission | Yes | Yes |
| OTX telemetry log | application/vnd.otx.telemetry.log | No | Yes |

!!! note "Notes:"

    <a name="mnote1">1.</a> The file manager (at least Nautilus / Gnome) will offer mwp as the default application to open the file.

    <a name="mnote2">2.</a>  DnD. The file can be dropped onto the mwp map and will be opened. The file may also be provided on the mwp command line without `--option`; e.g. `mwp --mission demo.mission` and `mwp demo.mission` will behave in the same way.
